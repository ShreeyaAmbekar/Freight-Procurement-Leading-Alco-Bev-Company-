# Freight-Procurement-Leading-Alco-Bev-Company-

Project Overview:
Welcome folks! 
This project is a freight procurement dashboard created for a leading alcoholic beverage company. As an employee of a company that thrives on saving up logistics spending for top FMCG/FMCD companies, I have been exploring various key influencers that directly impact the company's overall budget. Here, I have represented the outcomes of the initial freight procurement process by providing deep insights into transporter participation and initial estimated savings/escalations on the total amount spent. 

Industry Insights: Logistics Industry contributes nearly 7%-8% to India's GDP, a significant chunk. A lot of industry players are now moving towards efficient ways of procuring freight. Digitisation has now remarkably changed the conventional ways of Supply Chain. Whereas, leading manufacturing players have taken a step toward sustainability-led growth by enabling collaboration and renewable resources.
