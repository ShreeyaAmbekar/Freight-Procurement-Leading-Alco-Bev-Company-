# Freight-Procurement-Leading-Alco-Bev-Company-

Project Overview:
Welcome folks! 
This project is a freight procurement dashboard created for a leading alcoholic beverage company. As an employee of a company that thrives to save up logistics spend for top FMCG/FMCD companies, I have been exploring on various key influencers that have direct impact on the company's overall budget. Here, I have represented the outcomes of initial process of freight procurement by providing deep insights on transporter participation and initial estimated savings/escalations on the total amount spent.
